# Java-GUI-Database-Application
This project involves the development of a Java GUI application that simulates the operations of an energy company. The application is built using the Eclipse IDE and utilizes a MySQL database for data storage. The connection between the application and the database is established using the MySQL Connector.

## Functionality

The energy company simulation application provides various functionalities to manage and monitor energy-related operations. Some key features include:

1. **Customer Management**: The application allows the company to create and manage customer accounts. It provides features for customer registration, account information updates, and customer search based on specific criteria.

2. **Meter Readings**: The application enables the recording of meter readings for customer accounts. It allows the company to track energy consumption, generate usage reports, and calculate billing information based on the recorded readings.

3. **Billing and Payment**: The application supports the generation of bills for customers based on their meter readings and tariff plans. It also facilitates payment processing and tracks payment history for each customer.


## Development Environment

The application is developed using the Eclipse IDE, a popular integrated development environment for Java. Eclipse provides a comprehensive set of tools and features to streamline Java application development, including code editing, debugging, and project management capabilities.

The MySQL database, which serves as the backend for the application, is managed using the MySQL Workbench. MySQL Workbench is a graphical tool that allows for convenient database administration, schema design, and query execution.

To establish the connection between the application and the MySQL database, the MySQL Connector/J library is used. This library provides the necessary classes and methods to interact with the MySQL database from within the Java application.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the energy company simulation application on your development environment, follow these steps or **(Follow the steps on the provide pdf file)**:

1. Install the Eclipse IDE and MySQL Workbench on your system, if not already installed.

2. Download the MySQL Connector/J library from the MySQL website.

3. Create a new Java project in Eclipse for the energy company simulation application.

4. Add the downloaded MySQL Connector/J library (JAR file) to the project's classpath in Eclipse.

5. Set up a MySQL database using the MySQL Workbench. Create the necessary tables and define the schema according to the application's requirements.

6. Update the application's database connection configuration, such as the database URL, username, and password, in the Java code to establish a connection with the MySQL database.

7. Build and run the application in Eclipse to verify the connection and functionality.

Ensure that you have the appropriate MySQL server running and accessible to establish a successful connection between the application and the database.

## Future Improvements

The energy company simulation application can be further enhanced with additional features and functionalities. Some possible improvements include:

- Integration of advanced analytics and forecasting algorithms to provide energy consumption predictions and optimize energy distribution.

- Integration of real-time data monitoring using IoT devices to provide live energy consumption updates and enable better load management.

- Incorporation of a responsive and intuitive user interface design to improve the user experience and make the application more visually appealing.
